Known Issues
============

This document is an overview of known issues in ProbLog and their resolution.

Issue 1: DSharp error (on Mac OSX)
-----------------------------------------------

Compilation to d-DNNFs using the default DSharp compiler on Mac OSX can cause issues.

There are three solutions:

    - Use SDDs instead of d-DNNFs.
        In most cases d-DNNFs can be replaced by SDDs. 
        You can install the SDD library by running the ProbLog installer:
            
            ./problog-cli.py install
            
        Once the library is installed, it will be used by default.
        
    - Use BDDs instead of d-DNNFs.
        This requires Python3 and the external library PyEDA.
        Once the library is installed, you can use the option '-k bdd' to use BDDs.
        
    - Use the Windows version of the c2d knowledge compiler through Wine.
        Instructions can be found in problog/bin/darwin/cnf2dDNNF_wine
        
        When c2d is found, it will be used automatically instead of DSharp.
        
For most cases option 1 is sufficient.
