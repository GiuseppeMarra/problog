Whirl ProbLog implementation
============================

ProbLog implementation of the Word-based Heterogeneous Information
Representation Language (WHIRL) by W. W. Cohen.

information representation language. ACM Transactions on Information
Systems (TOIS), 18(3):288–321, 2000.


Usage
-----

Uncomment the query/1 predicates you want to run and execute the following
command:

    $ ./problog-cli whirl.pl

To keep the use case simple, the input texts (reviews) are prepared twice, once
as .txt files to build the TF-IDF model in Python and once as Prolog facts for
ProbLog to perform reasoning.


Differences
-----------

**Recursion and negation:**  
WHIRL does not allow for recursion or negation. Additionally, only one
many/2 predicate is allowed in a query. These restrictions do not apply
to Problog because it knows how to handle such situations (e.g. the
inclusion-exclusion principle).

**Search strategy:**  
Problog does not use a find-best-substitution approach, whereas the WHIRL
system uses an A* search strategy. The default reasoning technique in
Problog finds all proofs.
